# RMQ

A standalone Lean 4 formalization project for reusable range-minimum query
correctness results.

This repository started as a small extraction from a VeriBench-oriented RMQ
development. The code here is intentionally library-shaped rather than
benchmark-shaped: the goal is to factor reusable specifications, backend
contracts, and correctness lemmas that can support multiple RMQ algorithms.

## Current Status

The project currently builds without Mathlib, using only Lean/Std plus `omega`.
It proves a common half-open, leftmost-argmin contract for:

- a direct linear scan backend,
- a sparse table backend, and
- a hybrid block backend with boundary scans and sparse middle summaries.

The hybrid proof is already factored through a generic three-piece combinator:
an exact nonempty left boundary, an optional middle interval, and an optional
right interval combine into one exact leftmost argmin witness.

## Layout

- `RMQ/Core/Spec.lean`: query validity, `LeftmostArgMin`, index combination,
  and reusable exactness combinators.
- `RMQ/Core/Window.lean`: direct scan/window lemmas.
- `RMQ/Core/Backend.lean`: explicit backend interface with soundness,
  completeness, and invalid-query rejection.
- `RMQ/Core/Recursion.lean`: Mathlib-free well-founded recursion over strictly
  shorter summary lists, concrete full-block minimum summaries, and lifting
  lemmas from summary candidates back to original-list candidates.
- `RMQ/Impl/LinearScan.lean`: simplest exact backend.
- `RMQ/Impl/SparseTable.lean`: sparse table cells, materialized table lookup,
  and backend proof.
- `RMQ/Impl/HybridBlock.lean`: block summaries, sparse middle query, public
  hybrid query, and backend proof.

## Build

The project is pinned to Lean `leanprover/lean4:v4.22.0`.

```powershell
lake build
```

Useful proof-hygiene check:

```powershell
rg -n "sorry|admit|axiom|unsafe|opaque|implemented_by" RMQ lakefile.toml
```

## Next Direction

The next proof direction is to instantiate the recursive hybrid construction
over the concrete block-minimum summary problem: use a recursively constructed
summary backend to answer the middle full-block query, lift the selected block
back to an original index, and plug that candidate into the existing hybrid
combinator.
