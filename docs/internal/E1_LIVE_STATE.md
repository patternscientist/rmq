# E1 LIVE STATE

**Read this instead of `E1_WORKLOG.md`.** The worklog is a 7,500-line
append-only archive of 24 sessions; reading it whole was costing every session a
large fraction of its budget. Consult it only for a NAMED section.

Maintained by coordinator C05. Every anchor below was grep-verified at the
commit named. If you find one wrong, say so in your report — coordinator
addressing claims have failed inspection nine times this campaign and every
catch has come from a worker.

## 1. Where things stand

Campaign branch `claude/b1-b2-charged-fringe-tables`, HEAD `f3d96e2`.

**All eleven rows of `E1_AMENDED_MACHINE_ACCEPTANCE_MATRIX.md` are Open.** They
are whole-query scoped by deliberate design, so no interior-leg component can
close one. Do not expect to close a row until the whole-query glue lands; do not
weaken a row to make one closable.

## 2. The interior leg's ACTUAL structure

Mapped by reading `InteriorDirectory.lean:2300-2468` (the file is under
`SuccinctClose/EndpointFringe/InteriorCandidate/`). Earlier coordinator ladders
under-counted this — there are **three macro combiners** between the two-span
blocks and the dispatch that were never enumerated.

| # | Route computation | Line | Reads? | Machine side |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `...MinCandidateComputation` | 2300 | 4 (via summary group) | **DONE** |
| 2 | `...LocalSpanCandidateComputation` | 2311 | 1, then `some`→#1 / `none`→pure | **pattern DONE**, instantiation owed |
| 3 | `...GlobalSpanCandidateComputation` | 2329 | 1, then `some`→#1 / `none`→pure | **pattern DONE**, instantiation owed |
| 4 | `...LocalTwoSpanCandidateComputation` | 2351 | 1, then level/span split, two #2 merged | owed |
| 5 | `...GlobalTwoSpanCandidateComputation` | 2376 | 1, then two #3 merged | owed |
| 6 | `...AdjacentMacroCandidateComputation` | 2400 | **none** — two #4, merged | owed |
| 7 | `...LeftMiddleMacroCandidateComputation` | 2413 | **none** — #4 + #5, merged | owed |
| 8 | `...CrossMacroCandidateComputation` | 2426 | **none** — #4 + #5 + #4, merge3 | owed |
| 9 | `...InteriorRangeMinComputation` | 2444 | **none** — 5-way dispatch | owed |

**There are only THREE structural patterns here, instantiated seven times.**
#2/#3 are the same block modulo table and slot. #4/#5 are the same block modulo
which span block they call. #6/#7/#8 are read-free merge combiners over
sub-legs. Building each pattern PARAMETRICALLY and instantiating it is the
difference between one session and three — and parametric statements are also
what makes them kernel-executable (see §4).

**The #2/#3 pattern is built** (M3d-25, `E1InteriorSpanBlock.lean`). The
parametric-pattern claim above HELD for it: one `spanBlock`, parametric in a
`TableGeom`, covers both, because the two block-index maps
(`macroIdx * macroSize + value` and `value`) are both `off + value` for a
caller-supplied `off`. What remains for #2/#3 is narrow and mechanical:

- define the two `TableGeom`s (`localSpanGeom`, `globalSpanGeom`) the way
  `canonicalSummaryLayout` (`E1InteriorSummaryGroup.lean:464`) defines its four;
- link `spanValue` to the route's computation value. **The gate on this was
  `hexact` at the two span tables, and it is now open**: `hexact_local` /
  `hexact_global` landed at `E1InteriorChunkStore.lean:514`/`:537`. Compose them
  through `geomCell_eq_routeDecode` (`:674`) and
  `geomRouteDecode_eq_readComputation_value` (`:904`) exactly as the four
  summary bridges at `:737`–`:800` do. All three of that second lemma's
  hypotheses should be `rfl` at a correctly-written `TableGeom`.

Caps for both are already proved: `chunkCount_{pos,le_eight}_offsetWidth` and
`..._blockAddressWidth` (`E1InteriorChunkCap.lean:138`,`:146`,`:206`,`:212`).
The level-table caps #4/#5 will need are there too (`:155`,`:165`,`:218`,`:232`).

**CORRECTION TO THIS FILE'S OWN §3, made by the worker who used it.**
`candMerge3` is **not** reusable for #8. `bpCandidateMerge3?_some_left_right`
(`E1CandMerge3.lean:139`) takes `left right : Nat × Nat` — BARE PAIRS, not
options — so the block assumes the left and right arms are OCCUPIED, which is
the fringe's situation and not the interior's, where all three sub-legs are
`Option`. Its epilogue also writes `fRes = mAP - 1`, the `bpCandidateClose?`
CLOSED POSITION, whereas #6/#7/#8 need the merged CANDIDATE left in the bank.
**There is no two-way merge block on the machine side at all**, and #4, #5, #6
and #7 all need one (`bpCandidateMerge?`). Budget for building it.

**#9's five branches**, read off the source: `count = 0` → `pure none`;
`count ≤ macroSize - localStart` → #4; `middleMacroCount = 0` → #6;
`rightCount = 0` → #7; else → #8.

## 3. Landed machinery you should USE, not rebuild

| Fact | Anchor |
|---|---|
| composed 177-instruction interior leg | `summaryMinCandidate_runsTo` — `E1InteriorMinCandidate.lean:963` |
| its receipt = the route's read log | `summaryMachineTrace_eq_routeReads` — `:1237` |
| min-candidate receipt | `minCandidateMachineTrace_eq_routeReads` — `:1296` |
| summary group, all 8 premises supplied | `canonicalSummaryGroup_runsTo` — `E1InteriorSummaryGroup.lean:555` |
| machine cell = route computation value | `routeDecode_eq_machineReadComputation_value` — `:879` |
| block lengths (177 = 156 + 21) | `summaryGroup_length` `:299`, `minCandidateBlock_length` `E1InteriorMinCandidate.lean:241` |
| read-free 3-way merge — **fringe-shaped, see §2 correction** | `candMerge3` — `E1CandMerge3.lean:198`, `candMerge3_readFree` `:206` |
| merge algebra | `bpCandidateMerge?_some_left` `:132`, `bpCandidateMerge3?_some_left_right` `:139` |
| cross-block arm awaiting `hInterior` | `crossBlockArmProgramAt_runsTo` — `E1CrossBlockArm.lean:1143` |
| interior fold preservation clause — **COMPOSED HEADLINE** | `interiorChunkFold_runsTo` `E1InteriorChunkFold.lean:1808`, clause at `:1835` |
| **the #2/#3 span block, both arms** | `spanBlock_runsTo` — `E1InteriorSpanBlock.lean:262` |
| **its `none`-arm discriminator** | `spanNoneArm_discriminates` — `E1InteriorSpanBlock.lean:540` |
| **177-leg preservation, now exported** | `LegUntouched` `E1InteriorMinCandidate.lean:934`, clause at `:1009` |
| **`hexact` at the two span tables** | `hexact_local` `E1InteriorChunkStore.lean:514`, `hexact_global` `:537` |
| four route branch decompositions | `E1RouteDecomposition.lean:41`, `:85`, `:121`, `:148` |
| close/LCA dispatch, both arms | `closeDispatch_runsTo_same` / `_cross` — `E1CloseDispatch.lean:187`/`:224` |
| same-block leg composed | `sameBlockDispatchProgram_runsTo` — `E1CloseCompose.lean:95` |

**Register allocation.** Merge bank `75..84`. Interior fold bank `89..99`.
Summary+min-candidate `105..117`. Span block `118..122` (`pSlot` 118 and
`pOff` 119 are INPUTS the caller writes; `pCell` 120, `pT` 121, `pOne` 122 are
scratch). **Next free block opens at `123`.**

## 4. Techniques that are state of the art here

- **The kernel boundary is a property of a STATEMENT'S SHAPE, not of the
  mathematics.** `machineWordBits` → `Nat.log2` is well-founded recursion: the
  compiler evaluates it, the kernel cannot, so `rfl`/`decide` fail on
  shape-level fixtures. Parametrising `wordSize` moves the same equation into
  kernel-reachable territory with the shape-level form as an instance. Reach for
  this before concluding something cannot be witnessed.
- **An inline `match` in a statement elaborates a fresh auxiliary per
  declaration**, so an inversion lemma can be defeq to the goal and still not
  fire. Presents as "unsolved goals" on a goal `simp` visibly should close. Fix
  is to NAME the match, which is definitional, so no statement moves.
- **A whole-goal `simp` can leave two sides that print identically and do not
  close.** Localise into a per-segment bridge lemma.
- **A whnf heartbeat timeout can also mean your SIMP SET names a definition
  that unfolds into the concrete store.** §5's rule — never raise
  `maxHeartbeats` on an execution proof — is right, but the diagnosis is not
  always a stale read order. Putting `geomEvents`/`geomCats`/`geomCell` in a
  simp set forces `canonicalSummaryLayout`'s projections, hence
  `machineWordBits`, and times out. **Fix: convert into geom vocabulary ONCE, by
  defeq, with a typed `have`** — each is one delta step from the stage's own
  spelling, so the ascription is free — then never unfold it again. This is what
  made `spanBlock_runsTo` go through; see the comment at
  `E1InteriorSpanBlock.lean:335`.
- **Elaboration order bites `RunsTo.*` step lemmas.** `RunsTo.move (by simp)
  (by simpa using h.head)` can fail with the state still a metavariable. Bind
  the fetch in its own typed `have`, and pass `(s := ⟨…⟩)` explicitly.
- **Compose on the FOLD uniformly.** The 7-instruction atom
  (`interiorReadNat_route_atom`, `E1InteriorReadBlock.lean:443`) is single-chunk
  and unsound at reachable multi-chunk shapes — chunk counts are shape-dependent
  and are `(1,2,2,2)` at size 8.

## 5. Gotchas that have each cost a session

- `set`, `norm_num`, `by_contra` are **Mathlib** and unavailable here.
- Never raise `maxHeartbeats` on a proof about execution structure. A whnf
  heartbeat timeout there means a **stale read order** encoded in an append
  chain, not a resource shortage. The level read is the unconditional head of
  every two-span chain.
- `lake build <lib>` is binding only for the library — it misses `lean_exe`.
  Per-file `lake env lean` reports clean on commented-out code and writes no
  olean. `#print axioms` through an indirect import reports `unknown constant`
  for real theorems: import the module DIRECTLY.
- A green check is evidence only of what it examined. **A clause that is proved
  but never executed passes every check in the battery** — that is exactly how
  the interior preservation clause sat unexecuted while the fringe's twin ran.

## 6. The defect class that has bitten three times: RIGHT SHAPE, WRONG CONTENT

A category log of the right LENGTH with one slot wrong; a receipt in the right
ORDER with a stale head; a result `some` where the route is `none` with an
IDENTICAL trace. All pass length, read-count and exit-code checks. Only exact
positional, per-constructor comparison catches them.

**A fourth working model, and the sharpest one, is now in the tree**:
`spanNoneArm_discriminates` (`E1InteriorSpanBlock.lean:540`) with its four
companions. It is the third variety exactly — `some` where the route is `none`
— and the fixture establishes, by EXECUTION, that of the four things one can
check about that block, **none but the value rejects the impostor**: receipts
equal (`spanNoneArm_traces_agree`), both empty so read counts equal, both halt
(`spanNoneArm_both_halt`), and preservation holds on both arms
(`armOperands_preserved_impostor`). The one check that does catch it besides
the value is a POSITIONAL category comparison
(`spanNoneArm_catLogs_differ`) — recorded so the boundary is exact rather than
implied. Copy this shape: state the non-entailments, not just the discriminator.

Working models to copy: `witness_maxRel_discriminates`
(`E1InteriorMinCandidate.lean:817`), `linkWitness_discriminates_content`
(`E1InteriorSummaryGroup.lean:1090`), and the stale-head receipt fixture, whose
load-bearing part is `receiptWitness_staleHead_value_agrees` — it proves a
**non-entailment**, that a value equation is formally incapable of rejecting the
impostor. For each new block, ask which sub-leg's index differs from its
neighbours' and build the impostor there.

## 7. Still owed beyond the interior program

- **Interior preservation discriminator** — clause stated, never executed
  (§3). Being built on branch `claude/e1-interior-preservation`.
- **Closure ladder**: full LCA leg at canonical-store form; whole-query glue via
  `E1RouteDecomposition`; category accounting across ALL branches including
  selects-none and lca-none; the public `List Int` corollary; the **DERIVED**
  all-size step literal (from the category algebra and the caps 33/8/8 — derive,
  never assert); the amended-target Prop with its supersession note; the
  validator's whole-query phase; docs and matrix. One consolidated
  program-layout DD lands at the glue.
- **M7 doc claim** is scoped to QUERY TIME, construction-time carved out as
  preprocessing (`bpSparseLevelCell`, `SparseLevelTable.lean:55`). Do not write
  it until the interior leg exists.
- ~~**Prose only, deferred three times as concern-mixing**~~ — **DONE** (M3d-26).
  The `E1InteriorChunkStore.lean` header cited
  `probeShape_unbounded_agreement_fails`, which does not exist anywhere in the
  tree; the theorem is `unbounded_agreement_refuted`, now at `:594`. Folded in
  while editing that file for `hexact_local`/`hexact_global`.

## 8. Known red, externally owned — record, do not fix

`wordram_axiom_check.lean`, `axiom_check.lean`,
`lake exe rmq_succinct_classic_validate` (COMPILE-time failure).
Committed-range `git diff --check` flags whitespace solely in the inherited
`B7_STEP2_WIP.patch`.

## 9. Worklog — E1-LaneB, 2026-07-19 (M3d-25, M3d-25b, M3d-26)

Branch `claude/b1-b2-charged-fringe-tables`, base `c4595b7`, HEAD `f3d96e2`.
Three commits: `813fd04`, `e11eeaa`, `f3d96e2`.

**Built.** The #2/#3 parametric span block (`E1InteriorSpanBlock.lean`, new,
registered in `RMQ.lean`): `spanBlock` (222 instructions, exit `Q + 222` on both
arms), `spanBlock_runsTo` with receipt, charge log, value and preservation, and
the `none`-arm discriminator with its four non-entailments. Plus
`hexact_local`/`hexact_global`, and the 177-leg's preservation clause re-exported.

**Owed on this lane, in the order I would take them.** #2/#3's two `TableGeom`s
and route-value link (§2 says exactly how, and the gate is now open); then the
TWO-WAY merge block, which does not exist and which #4–#7 all need; then #4/#5;
then #6/#7/#8; then #9's five-branch dispatch; then `hInterior`.

**On `hInterior` specifically — the shape is known and the arithmetic checks
out, so do not re-derive it.** `crossBlockArmProgramAt_runsTo`
(`E1CrossBlockArm.lean:1143`) needs, at base `A + 176`: a `RunsTo` to
`A + 176 + interior.length`, `bestOfRegs (regsI mMV) (regsI mMP) = interiorValue`,
and preservation of `fClose` (70), `fRight` (71), `mLV` (75), `mLP` (76).
All four survive the 177-leg — `legUntouched_at_crossBlockArm_operands`
(`E1InteriorMinCandidate.lean:945`) EVALUATES that — and all four survive the
whole span block (`spanUntouched_at_crossBlockArm_operands`,
`E1InteriorSpanBlock.lean:232`). So the preservation half of `hInterior` is
already discharged for everything built so far; what is missing is only #9's
program to run.

**Two things I got wrong mid-session, recorded because the same traps are live.**
(1) My first `SpanUntouched` was false at `r = 76`, i.e. it declined to claim
`mLP` — a preservation predicate can be too WEAK and still typecheck, and
nothing catches that but reading it against the consumer's needs. It is marked
SUPERSEDED in the module rather than silently rewritten.
(2) Every line number I wrote into §3 from memory was wrong, and inserting
`LegUntouched` shifted `summaryMinCandidate_runsTo` from `:929` to `:963`,
staling four citations I had not written. Grep your own output; the worklog's
historical `:929` references were left alone as records of what was true then.
