# RMQ POC — Audit Snapshot + Cost-Model (Target A) Design

Staging note: this doc lives on the audit branch. As of the latest round,
Codex's working-tree `docs/ROADMAP.md` and `docs/CODEX_AUTONOMY.md` are the
**canonical** steering docs (Codex reconciled the A–D framing and the
proactive-proof-worker policy into them by content). Apply the Part 2 rewrite to
*that* canonical `ROADMAP.md`, not to the audit-branch copy.

# Part 1 — Audit snapshot

**Scope.** Full current development: 33 Lean modules (20 `Core/`, 13 `Impl/`) +
`scripts/axiom_check.lean`, ~17.1k lines, aggregated by `RMQ.lean` (all 33
imported — no orphan modules). `SparseTableCost.lean` was retired.

**Health.**
- `lake build`: green.
- Hygiene: no `sorry`/`admit`/`axiom`/`native_decide`/`partial`/`extern`/`noncomputable`.
- Trust base: every curated headline theorem depends only on
  `{propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}` (several need fewer; the RAM/refine
  primitives need none or `[propext]`). Zero `sorryAx`/`ofReduceBool`.

**Module map (hub vs spoke).**
- Hub candidates in `Core/`: `Cost`, `RAM`, `Refine`, `TableModel`,
  `LowerBound` (the reusable infrastructure) + the RMQ reference theory
  (`Spec`, `Window`, `Backend`, `Shape`, `Cartesian`, `LCA`, `Reduction`,
  `EncodingLowerBound`, `Microtable`, `Recursion`, `Schedule`, `PlusMinusOne`,
  `Succinct`, `SuccinctReduction`, `CostKernels`).
- Spoke impls in `Impl/`: linear scan, sparse table (+ memo cost +
  instrumented), hybrid block, recursive hybrid (+ cost), Fischer-Heun (+ cost),
  microtable backend, LCA cost, LCA-via-Fischer-Heun, equivalence.

**A–D scorecard.**

| Target | Status | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| **A** machine-step cost model | 🟡 partial | `Core.RAM` trace monad; sparse build (O(n log n)) + query (≤7) refine the verified backend with derived steps. **But** `Exec.primitive op x` takes an externally supplied value, and some value-plumbing is uncounted → today's "steps" is a *probe/comparison/indexed-access count, not a machine-step count*. (The `xs.toList.length` guard leak was fixed → `Array.size`.) |
| **B** refinement framework + 2 instances | 🟡 interface done, FH hybrid | `Core.Refine.StoredMatrix α abs` (`repr` + `erases`) is a clean, generic, hub-placed interface. Sparse table is a fully-derived instance. FH's **summary** leg now routes through it (`liftedSummaryStoredQuery_refines_recursiveMiddle_with_steps`), but FH's **boundary microtable** lookups remain asserted (`materializedMicrotableLookupCost := 1`, 9 sites) → FH is not yet a fully-derived second instance. |
| **C** lower-bound framework + RMQ instance | 🟢 done | `Core.LowerBound` is generic (docstring: "does not mention RMQ, Cartesian trees, or shapes"): finite bitstring universe, finite-domain `LosslessEncoding`, injection/capacity counting, log-slack arithmetic. `EncodingLowerBound` re-derives the no-premise `2n − (2log₂(2n+1)+2)` bound *through* it. Reusable, non-vacuous (decoder answers from bits alone). |
| **D** one research headline | ⚪ not landed | D-LCA: correctness done (`IsPathLCA` via `LCAFischerHeun`/`SuccinctReduction`); cost still query-side and gated (`canonicalConcreteQueryCosted_cost_le_fourteen_of_firstOccurrences` — 11→14 is honest re-accounting, not regression). D-Space: todo. |

**Finish line:** A + B + C + one of D. **C done; B ≈70% (FH hybrid); A ≈50%
(derived but probe-count, escape hatch open); D correctness-only.**

**The one persistent gap:** FH stays a hybrid until its boundary microtable
lookups are migrated off `materializedMicrotableLookupCost := 1` to traced
reads. This is *the same task* as part of hardening A (route the lookups through
counted primitives), and it is what closes B's second instance.

**No filler this round; debt is trending down** (asserted sparse build-cost
layer and the strictly-worse naive traced build were retired). The loop is now
running longer multi-target rounds (C + B-continuation in one) and reconciling
the steering docs itself.

# Part 2 — Target A design: harden the shallow monad; defer the interpreter

## The choice, plainly

Two ways to make cost claims real, both over the standard unit-cost RAM model
(one array read = one step — the assumption everyone, including cell-probe
theory, uses):

- **(a) Shallow / monadic** *(what exists now: `RAM.Exec`)*: cost is defined
  alongside the program; each primitive emits a tick; `bind` sums them. The
  value is computed by ordinary Lean and the step-count rides along.
- **(b) First-order interpreter**: the program is a *data object* and `eval`
  runs it, returning `(value, steps)` from the *same* execution — so value and
  step-count cannot diverge by construction.

## Recommendation

**Harden (a); do not build (b) for the POC.** Reserve (b) for a future
*machine-model lower bound* (cell-probe), which is the only setting that truly
needs a formal machine as an object — and the encoding-based lower bound (C) is
already done without it.

## Why (this is the reasoning, not just the verdict)

1. **(a) is the extant norm.** Nipkow's *Functional Algorithms, Verified!* — the
   standard reference for verified functional-DS complexity — defines a timing
   function by structural recursion alongside each algorithm; no operational
   semantics. CSLib's `TimeM` is the monadic version of the same idea. So (a) is
   the accepted, published, **CSLib-compatible** way to do *upper bounds*.
2. **(b) is for machine-model lower bounds, which aren't on the critical path.**
   Its distinctive payoff is reasoning about *every possible* algorithm in a
   fixed machine. The current lower bound is information-theoretic / encoding-
   based and needs no machine model; D-LCA is an upper-bound result. So (b)'s
   killer app is absent here. Building it now is over-engineering.
3. **The honesty objection was never (a)-vs-(b).** The probe-count caveat came
   from *incomplete counting* and an *escape hatch*, not from the monad. Nipkow-
   grade (a) is honest precisely because it counts every operation. Fixing the
   counting yields an honest machine-step upper bound in the unit-cost RAM
   model — exactly what the accepted literature provides — without an
   interpreter.
4. **It collapses two open items into one.** Hardening (a) and closing B (FH's
   asserted microtable leg) are the *same* work: route the currently-asserted
   operations through counted primitives.

## Concrete hardening checklist (this is the real "done" for A)

1. **Close the escape hatch.** Remove/forbid the `Exec.primitive (op) (x)`
   constructor that pairs a trace entry with an *arbitrary* value. Expose only
   *typed, value-computing* primitives (`readArray? xs i` returns the real
   `xs[i]?`, `compareLtInt`, `branch`, `allocArray`, `push`). Then value/trace
   correspondence is **structural** for any program built from the combinators —
   most of (b)'s guarantee, inside (a).
2. **Count all plumbing.** Replace value-side `List` bookkeeping that currently
   rides outside the trace — `cellsPrefix ++ [cell]` snoc, `toArray`/`toList`
   conversions — with counted operations (e.g. `Array.push`), or count them
   explicitly, so `steps` is an honest machine-step *upper bound*, not just a
   probe count.
3. **Migrate Fischer-Heun's boundary microtable lookups** off
   `materializedMicrotableLookupCost := 1` to traced array reads through the
   same primitives. This makes FH a *fully-derived* `Refine` instance and closes
   B's "two instances" criterion.
4. **State the hardened done-shape** (no `eval` interpreter required):

   ```lean
   -- sparse table (already close: memoQueryWithTracedBuild_refine_with_steps,
   -- once the escape hatch is closed and plumbing is counted)
   theorem sparse_refines_with_steps :
     (tracedBuildQuery xs left right).value = SparseTable.query xs left right ∧
     buildSteps ≤ c₁ * xs.length * Nat.log2 xs.length ∧
     querySteps ≤ c₂
   -- Fischer-Heun (the new B instance, fully derived):
   theorem fischerHeun_refines_with_steps :
     (tracedFH xs left right).value = FischerHeun.query xs left right ∧
     buildSteps ≤ c₁ * xs.length ∧
     querySteps ≤ c₂
   ```

   where every `…Steps` is the trace length of a program whose value is built
   only by counted primitives.
5. **Defer the interpreter.** Note explicitly in the roadmap that a first-order
   `eval`-based RAM/query model is the *stronger* backing reserved for a future
   machine-model lower-bound spoke (and aligns with CSLib's stated "explicit RAM
   and query models" future work). It is **not** the POC finish line for A.

## Honest residual caveats (state these; don't paper over them)

- The unit-cost RAM model is still a model: one array read counts as one step
  regardless of word size / cache. This is the standard, universally-used
  assumption — not a defect — but the claim is "machine-step in the unit-cost
  RAM model," and the docs should say exactly that.
- Even with the escape hatch closed, *discipline* remains partly load-bearing
  (an author can still write an inefficient value-construction). Removing the
  raw-value constructor and proving the refinement to the verified backend
  minimizes this to the same residual that Nipkow-style timing functions carry,
  which the field accepts.

## Proposed replacement for the ROADMAP "A" section

Rewrite A's *Done theorem shape* and *Gap* so the finish line is the hardened
shallow monad (checklist items 1–4 above), with the `eval` interpreter listed
under a new "Deferred / future" line (item 5) rather than as the required shape.
Everything else in the current A section (intent, current status, the
`Array.size` guard note) stays.

## Provenance

Audit performed against the working-tree state on 2026-06-18. Build green, trust
base standard-axioms-only. This doc records the snapshot and the A design
rationale; the actionable edit is the Part 2 rewrite applied to the canonical
working-tree `ROADMAP.md`.

# Round log

## 2026-06-18 (later round) — FH microtable: unwired-migration stop ⚠️

**What landed (real):** the RAM escape hatch was closed — `Exec.primitive` is now
`private`, public users get only typed value-computing primitives
(`readArray?`, `compareLtInt`, `branch`, `allocArray`, `push`). That is a genuine
A-hardening (checklist item 1) and makes value/trace correspondence structural.

**What went wrong (the pattern to learn from):** the round also built a traced
FH boundary-microtable path — `storedMicrotableForInput` and
`storedLocalBlockCandidateCosted` (with `_value_of_lt` / `_cost` theorems) — but
**left it wired into nothing.** Verified: those names are referenced only inside
their own definitions and their own theorems; the live query
`queryWithStateCosted` still calls the asserted `localBlockCandidateCosted`
(`materializedMicrotableLookupCost := 1`, still 9 live sites), and the FH ≤11
bound is still the asserted one. There is no `fischerHeun_refines_with_steps`
capstone.

**Net:** build green, trust base clean — but **no target closed and the
asserted-cost debt grew** (a derived path added beside the asserted one,
≈ +252/−2 lines; the new path is dead code). Target B is still open.

**Was the stop justified? No.** The completion is non-forky and needs no `State`
change (`storedMicrotableForInput xs blockSize` builds on the fly):
1. substitute `storedLocalBlockCandidateCosted` for `localBlockCandidateCosted`
   in the live `queryWithStateCosted`;
2. discharge the `_of_lt` in-bounds obligation from the query's `ValidRange`
   (ordinary proof work — do **not** leave the refinement permanently
   conditional);
3. retire `localBlockCandidateCosted` / `materializedMicrotableLookupCost`;
4. state `fischerHeun_refines_with_steps` and add it to `scripts/axiom_check.lean`.

**Loop rule added by this finding:** *never stop with unwired scaffolding.*
Building a parallel structure and not connecting it (no consumer, no retired
predecessor, no capstone) is a stop-condition violation, not a checkpoint — it
closes no target, leaves dead code, and does not reduce a tracked debt metric.
A round that builds derived machinery must, in the same round, wire it into the
live path and retire what it replaces, or it has not earned a green light.

**Next run:** finish this migration (steps 1–4) to close B before starting any
new target. C is done; D-LCA is next after B.
