# RMQ POC — Audit Snapshot + Cost-Model (Target A) Design

Staging note: this doc was imported from the audit branch as a historical audit
record. The working-tree `docs/ROADMAP.md` and `docs/CODEX_AUTONOMY.md` are the
**canonical** steering docs. In particular, the current roadmap keeps
Mathlib-free Lean/Std as the default and refines D-LCA toward a dense
direct-address node-ID theorem while preserving arbitrary-label correctness.
Use this document for audit rationale and failure-mode reminders, not as an
override of the live roadmap.

# Part 1 — Audit snapshot

**Scope.** Full current development: 33 Lean modules (20 `Core/`, 13 `Impl/`) +
`scripts/axiom_check.lean`, ~17.1k lines, aggregated by `RMQ.lean` (all 33
imported — no orphan modules). `SparseTableCost.lean` was retired.

**Health.**
- `lake build`: green.
- Hygiene: no `sorry`/`admit`/`axiom`/`native_decide`/`partial`/`extern`/`noncomputable`.
- Trust base: every curated headline theorem depends only on
  `{propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}` (several need fewer; the RAM/refine
  primitives need none or `[propext]`). Zero `sorryAx`/`ofReduceBool`.

**Module map (hub vs spoke).**
- Hub candidates in `Core/`: `Cost`, `RAM`, `Refine`, `TableModel`,
  `LowerBound` (the reusable infrastructure) + the RMQ reference theory
  (`Spec`, `Window`, `Backend`, `Shape`, `Cartesian`, `LCA`, `Reduction`,
  `EncodingLowerBound`, `Microtable`, `Recursion`, `Schedule`, `PlusMinusOne`,
  `Succinct`, `SuccinctReduction`, `CostKernels`).
- Spoke impls in `Impl/`: linear scan, sparse table (+ memo cost +
  instrumented), hybrid block, recursive hybrid (+ cost), Fischer-Heun (+ cost),
  microtable backend, LCA cost, LCA-via-Fischer-Heun, equivalence.

**A–D scorecard.**

Current override: the historical scorecard below predates the latest loop.
The live roadmap now treats the POC finish line as landed with A/B/C plus
D-LCA under the hardened-shallow RAM/component-budget model. The demo-facing
D-LCA theorem is
`LCAFischerHeun.denseLCA_linearBuild_constantQuery_profile`; the remaining
work is post-POC fidelity hardening, especially a first-order RAM interpreter
and one monolithic executable dense-LCA preprocessing trace.

| Target | Status | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| **A** machine-step cost model | POC complete, interpreter future | `Core.RAM` is a hardened shallow trace substrate: raw primitives are sealed, sparse build/query use derived traces, FH stored summary/local reads are charged through counted adapters, and the `xs.toList.length` guard leak was fixed to `Array.size`. It is still a probe/indexed-access trace model, not a first-order machine interpreter. |
| **B** refinement framework + 2 instances | POC complete | `Core.Refine.StoredMatrix`/`StoredSeq` now support sparse-table queries, FH summary tables, and dense LCA first-occurrence/node/depth stores. FH boundary microtable reads are no longer the old asserted `materializedMicrotableLookupCost := 1` path; the public large-regime supplied-query bound is `<= 13`. |
| **C** lower-bound framework + RMQ instance | 🟢 done | `Core.LowerBound` is generic (docstring: "does not mention RMQ, Cartesian trees, or shapes"): finite bitstring universe, finite-domain `LosslessEncoding`, injection/capacity counting, log-slack arithmetic. `EncodingLowerBound` re-derives the no-premise `2n − (2log₂(2n+1)+2)` bound *through* it. Reusable, non-vacuous (decoder answers from bits alone). |
| **D** one research headline | D-LCA landed | `denseLCA_linearBuild_constantQuery_profile` is the selected POC headline: dense/preindexed labels, canonical large-regime Euler depths, linear assembled preprocessing budget `22 * eulerTrace.nodes.length + 3`, path-LCA query correctness, query cost `<= 16`, and combined build-plus-query budget. D-Space remains optional future work. |

**Finish line:** A + B + C + one of D. The POC finish line is now landed under
the documented hardened-shallow RAM/component-budget model.

**The persistent post-POC gap:** this is not yet a full first-order RAM
interpreter or one monolithic RAM execution for dense LCA preprocessing. Those
are the next fidelity upgrades, not blockers for the scoped RMQ POC.

**No filler this round; debt is trending down** (asserted sparse build-cost
layer and the strictly-worse naive traced build were retired). The loop is now
running longer multi-target rounds (C + B-continuation in one) and reconciling
the steering docs itself.

# Part 2 — Target A design: harden the shallow monad; defer the interpreter

## The choice, plainly

Two ways to make cost claims real, both over the standard unit-cost RAM model
(one array read = one step — the assumption everyone, including cell-probe
theory, uses):

- **(a) Shallow / monadic** *(what exists now: `RAM.Exec`)*: cost is defined
  alongside the program; each primitive emits a tick; `bind` sums them. The
  value is computed by ordinary Lean and the step-count rides along.
- **(b) First-order interpreter**: the program is a *data object* and `eval`
  runs it, returning `(value, steps)` from the *same* execution — so value and
  step-count cannot diverge by construction.

## Recommendation

**Harden (a); do not build (b) for the POC.** Reserve (b) for a future
*machine-model lower bound* (cell-probe), which is the only setting that truly
needs a formal machine as an object — and the encoding-based lower bound (C) is
already done without it.

## Why (this is the reasoning, not just the verdict)

1. **(a) is the extant norm.** Nipkow's *Functional Algorithms, Verified!* — the
   standard reference for verified functional-DS complexity — defines a timing
   function by structural recursion alongside each algorithm; no operational
   semantics. CSLib's `TimeM` is the monadic version of the same idea. So (a) is
   the accepted, published, **CSLib-compatible** way to do *upper bounds*.
2. **(b) is for machine-model lower bounds, which aren't on the critical path.**
   Its distinctive payoff is reasoning about *every possible* algorithm in a
   fixed machine. The current lower bound is information-theoretic / encoding-
   based and needs no machine model; D-LCA is an upper-bound result. So (b)'s
   killer app is absent here. Building it now is over-engineering.
3. **The honesty objection was never (a)-vs-(b).** The probe-count caveat came
   from *incomplete counting* and an *escape hatch*, not from the monad. Nipkow-
   grade (a) is honest precisely because it counts every operation. Fixing the
   counting yields an honest machine-step upper bound in the unit-cost RAM
   model — exactly what the accepted literature provides — without an
   interpreter.
4. **It collapses two open items into one.** Hardening (a) and closing B (FH's
   asserted microtable leg) are the *same* work: route the currently-asserted
   operations through counted primitives.

## Concrete hardening checklist (this is the real "done" for A)

1. **Close the escape hatch.** Remove/forbid the `Exec.primitive (op) (x)`
   constructor that pairs a trace entry with an *arbitrary* value. Expose only
   *typed, value-computing* primitives (`readArray? xs i` returns the real
   `xs[i]?`, `compareLtInt`, `branch`, `allocArray`, `push`). Then value/trace
   correspondence is **structural** for any program built from the combinators —
   most of (b)'s guarantee, inside (a).
2. **Count all plumbing.** Replace value-side `List` bookkeeping that currently
   rides outside the trace — `cellsPrefix ++ [cell]` snoc, `toArray`/`toList`
   conversions — with counted operations (e.g. `Array.push`), or count them
   explicitly, so `steps` is an honest machine-step *upper bound*, not just a
   probe count.
3. **Migrate Fischer-Heun's boundary microtable lookups** off
   `materializedMicrotableLookupCost := 1` to traced array reads through the
   same primitives. This makes FH a *fully-derived* `Refine` instance and closes
   B's "two instances" criterion.
4. **State the hardened done-shape** (no `eval` interpreter required):

   ```lean
   -- sparse table (already close: memoQueryWithTracedBuild_refine_with_steps,
   -- once the escape hatch is closed and plumbing is counted)
   theorem sparse_refines_with_steps :
     (tracedBuildQuery xs left right).value = SparseTable.query xs left right ∧
     buildSteps ≤ c₁ * xs.length * Nat.log2 xs.length ∧
     querySteps ≤ c₂
   -- Fischer-Heun (the new B instance, fully derived):
   theorem fischerHeun_refines_with_steps :
     (tracedFH xs left right).value = FischerHeun.query xs left right ∧
     buildSteps ≤ c₁ * xs.length ∧
     querySteps ≤ c₂
   ```

   where every `…Steps` is the trace length of a program whose value is built
   only by counted primitives.
5. **Defer the interpreter.** Note explicitly in the roadmap that a first-order
   `eval`-based RAM/query model is the *stronger* backing reserved for a future
   machine-model lower-bound spoke (and aligns with CSLib's stated "explicit RAM
   and query models" future work). It is **not** the POC finish line for A.

## Honest residual caveats (state these; don't paper over them)

- The unit-cost RAM model is still a model: one array read counts as one step
  regardless of word size / cache. This is the standard, universally-used
  assumption — not a defect — but the claim is "machine-step in the unit-cost
  RAM model," and the docs should say exactly that.
- Even with the escape hatch closed, *discipline* remains partly load-bearing
  (an author can still write an inefficient value-construction). Removing the
  raw-value constructor and proving the refinement to the verified backend
  minimizes this to the same residual that Nipkow-style timing functions carry,
  which the field accepts.

## Proposed replacement for the ROADMAP "A" section

Rewrite A's *Done theorem shape* and *Gap* so the finish line is the hardened
shallow monad (checklist items 1–4 above), with the `eval` interpreter listed
under a new "Deferred / future" line (item 5) rather than as the required shape.
Everything else in the current A section (intent, current status, the
`Array.size` guard note) stays.

## Provenance

Audit performed against the working-tree state on 2026-06-18. Build green, trust
base standard-axioms-only. This doc records the snapshot and the A design
rationale; the actionable edit is the Part 2 rewrite applied to the canonical
working-tree `ROADMAP.md`.

# Round log

## 2026-06-18 (later round) — FH microtable: unwired-migration stop ⚠️

**What landed (real):** the RAM escape hatch was closed — `Exec.primitive` is now
`private`, public users get only typed value-computing primitives
(`readArray?`, `compareLtInt`, `branch`, `allocArray`, `push`). That is a genuine
A-hardening (checklist item 1) and makes value/trace correspondence structural.

**What went wrong (the pattern to learn from):** the round also built a traced
FH boundary-microtable path — `storedMicrotableForInput` and
`storedLocalBlockCandidateCosted` (with `_value_of_lt` / `_cost` theorems) — but
**left it wired into nothing.** Verified: those names are referenced only inside
their own definitions and their own theorems; the live query
`queryWithStateCosted` still calls the asserted `localBlockCandidateCosted`
(`materializedMicrotableLookupCost := 1`, still 9 live sites), and the FH ≤11
bound is still the asserted one. There is no `fischerHeun_refines_with_steps`
capstone.

**Net:** build green, trust base clean — but **no target closed and the
asserted-cost debt grew** (a derived path added beside the asserted one,
≈ +252/−2 lines; the new path is dead code). Target B is still open.

**Was the stop justified? No.** The completion is non-forky and needs no `State`
change (`storedMicrotableForInput xs blockSize` builds on the fly):
1. substitute `storedLocalBlockCandidateCosted` for `localBlockCandidateCosted`
   in the live `queryWithStateCosted`;
2. discharge the `_of_lt` in-bounds obligation from the query's `ValidRange`
   (ordinary proof work — do **not** leave the refinement permanently
   conditional);
3. retire `localBlockCandidateCosted` / `materializedMicrotableLookupCost`;
4. state `fischerHeun_refines_with_steps` and add it to `scripts/axiom_check.lean`.

**Loop rule added by this finding:** *never stop with unwired scaffolding.*
Building a parallel structure and not connecting it (no consumer, no retired
predecessor, no capstone) is a stop-condition violation, not a checkpoint — it
closes no target, leaves dead code, and does not reduce a tracked debt metric.
A round that builds derived machinery must, in the same round, wire it into the
live path and retire what it replaces, or it has not earned a green light.

**Next run:** finish this migration (steps 1–4) to close B before starting any
new target. C is done; D-LCA is next after B.

## 2026-06-18 (later) — B closed; D-LCA started (built state, with a fidelity gap) ✅/⚠️

**B is closed.** `fischerHeun_refines_with_steps` is a genuine capstone:
`(queryCosted xs left right).value = query xs left right ∧ cost ≤ 13`,
unconditional except for `canonicalReady` (legitimate large-input precondition).
Two fully-derived `Refine.StoredMatrix` instances (sparse + FH); asserted
microtable cost retired. The prior unwired-scaffolding round was correctly
finished rather than abandoned.

**D-LCA: real structural progress, honestly labeled as incomplete.** A
`ConcreteQueryState` (FH RMQ state + first-occurrence table + node view) was
assembled, and `queryWithBuiltConcreteStateCosted_refines_with_steps_of_tracePathAgreement`
makes the query consume a **built** first-occurrence table (drops the
`_of_firstOccurrences` *supplied* hypothesis), with correctness via
`tracePathAgreement` (discharged by `labelsUnique`).

**Two gaps — one disclosed, one not:**
1. *Build cost not charged (disclosed).* The `ConcreteQueryState` docstring
   states it "does not yet claim a faithful preprocessing cost for constructing
   the first-occurrence table." `queryWithBuiltConcreteStateCosted_cost_le_sixteen_of_large`
   bounds only the query (≤16); there is no `buildSteps ≤ c·n`.
2. *Lookup fidelity (undisclosed).* `firstOccurrences : TableModel.IndexedAccess`
   is populated with `firstOccurrenceAssocIndex` — an **assoc list** whose
   `firstOccurrenceAssocLookup?` (`LCACost.lean:74`) is an **O(n) linear scan** —
   but read via `getCosted`, which charges **unit cost**. So the ≤16 bound
   charges O(1) per first-occurrence lookup for O(n) work: the exact
   "modeled-O(1)-for-real-linear-work" pattern the FH/sparse hardening
   eliminated, reappearing in the LCA layer. Correctness is fine
   (`firstOccurrenceAssocIndex_get?_of_mem_labelsPreorder`); the issue is purely
   cost fidelity.

**Stop assessment: appropriate.** The round closed a real target (B) and laid
D-LCA groundwork that is *disclosed as incomplete* (not banked as done) — so,
unlike the prior unwired-microtable round, this is not a stop-rule violation.

**Caveat / do not bank:** the LCA `≤16 refines-with-steps` must **not** count
toward D-LCA "done": the build is uncosted and the assoc-list lookup is charged
O(1) for O(n) work.

**Next run (non-forky completion, reuses existing machinery):** re-back the
first-occurrence table with `Core.Refine.StoredMatrix` (Array — so the unit-cost
indexed read is *honest*) and charge its O(n) build through the RAM model, the
same way the sparse table and FH microtable were done. That closes both gaps at
once and yields the single build-plus-query theorem that is D-LCA's deliverable.
With B and C done and A nearly there, D-LCA done this way is essentially the POC
finish line.

## 2026-06-18 (final pass) - assoc path retired; dense D-LCA remains the headline

The assoc-list first-occurrence path described above has now been retired from
the compiled implementation and theorem inventory. The live LCA cost story is
the dense/preindexed node-ID path:

- `LCACost.firstOccurrenceDirectRows` / `firstOccurrenceDirectStored` provide
  the direct-address first-occurrence table.
- `LCAFischerHeun.buildDenseConcreteQueryState` builds the concrete query state
  from the canonical Fischer-Heun RMQ state, dense first-occurrence store, and
  node store.
- `queryWithBuiltDenseConcreteStateCosted_refines_with_steps_of_denseNatLabels`
  is the current built-state query capstone with the large-regime `<= 16`
  query bound.

The remaining D-LCA caveat is therefore no longer hidden linear lookup in an
assoc list. It is the normalization of the assembled component budget into the
final demo-facing theorem: choose the tree-size measure, state the dense-label
preprocessing-plus-query profile against it, and keep arbitrary-label LCA
correctness as the separate semantic layer.

## 2026-06-20 (succinct capstone) - blockers pinned; next round must be positive

The succinct BP-native RMQ path is now better constrained, but still not closed.
The latest merged work added design-constraining negative theorems:

- `SuccinctCloseProposal.blockPairMacroDirectory_not_sufficient`: endpoint
  close-block pairs are not enough information for an exact BP close/LCA macro.
- `SuccinctCloseProposal.denseAllCloseBPCloseLCAOverhead_not_littleO`: the
  direct all-close endpoint fallback is exact and charged, but not an `o(n)`
  auxiliary payload.
- `SuccinctSelectProposal.SelectSampleWordExact.shared_aligned_read_word_forces_same_wordIndex`
  and the two-level `shared_local_locator...` lemmas: one shared aligned
  payload word cannot serve successful selects whose answers lie in different
  chunks.

These results are useful anti-vacuity guards: they prevent a fake capstone over
an under-keyed macro, a dense non-succinct table, or a shared select locator
that silently reads the wrong payload word. They are not themselves the
succinct-RMQ capstone.

The companion note `docs/SUCCINCT_RESEARCH_AND_PLAN.md` records the current
positive plan: C1 descriptor select based on two-level select sampling; C2 a
Navarro-Sadakane-style BP range-min-max macro with charged endpoint-fringe
repair and a Four-Russians local micro table; C3 the concrete final join with
the existing `logSlackLower` lower-bound tie.

Stop assessment: the negative-theorem round was legitimate once because it
pruned tempting but false closes. The next round should not stop on another
blocker unless a concrete C1/C2 construction attempt makes the target
ill-specified and produces a minimal impossibility theorem. The expected
deliverable is a positive component profile or a concrete construction consumed
by such a profile.
